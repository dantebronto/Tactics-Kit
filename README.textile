h1. Setup

p. Make sure you have Ruby, Rails, and the following gems:

<pre>
haml v2.2.8
curb v0.5.4.0
rails_warden v0.3.0
</pre>

p. You should be able to run 
<pre>
  rake gems:install
</pre>

p. Next "install CouchDB":http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installation

p. After CouchDB is running on http://localhost:5984, you can run 
<pre>
  rake couch:create_db
</pre>

p. This will create the database, and all necessary views.

p. From here you can simply start the server (script/server) and create a login to begin playing. Enjoy!
